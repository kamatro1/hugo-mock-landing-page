# User Stories for Daily Xpert

Daily Xpert is the project I am working on for my Senior Design project. Daily Xpert seeks to improve X (FKA Twitter) users' ability to stay up to date on their favorite topics and accounts. It achieves this by sending them a daily email summarizing (using GPT-4) activity on X related to topics and users of their choosing. Through the user stories, you'll learn more about the utility of the project.
